# Tax_Estimate_Distributed_System
Personal Income Tax Estimate and Owing Distributed System in Python using SQLite3 and Pyro5 libraries
Use either user inputted data or use stored data found in the generate_data.py file

# Instructions to run distributed system using three-tiered approach
1. Pyro5 must be installed on local machine for RPC communication
2. Python 3.0 must be installed on local machine
3. Run first terminal for UI client
4. Run second terminal: Server_1.py and Object uri - must be noted and copied if they do not have TFN
5. Run third terminal: Server_2.py and Object uri - must be noted and copied if they have TFN
6. Follow prompts
7. Outputed results shall be displayed server side

# Improvements to be made
1. Implement custom id number and password inputs to reflect real world usage
2. Add more meaningful entries to sqlite database
